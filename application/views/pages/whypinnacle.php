				<div class="why-box">
					<p class="para">
						Pinnacle has been established with the motive of imparting the finest quality of
						eduation to the students. We claim to be the best and the following points
						support our claims:
					</p>
					<h1 class="why-title"> Experienced and Dedicated Faculty Team</h1>
					<p class="why-desc">
						The faculty team at Pinnacle needs no introduction as they have been proving their
						mettle for several years now. Our Senior team has members from IITs and other prestigious
						colleges, who not only know their subject but also know the student psychology to help
						them grasp the subject better. 
					</p>

					<h1 class="why-title"> All subjects under single roof system</h1>
					<p class="why-desc">
						Pinnacle has based its system on providing all the subjects under single roof, means no more traversing the city finding the best teacher. This results in saving time and hence students secure extra time for their scholastic and personal development
					</p>
					<p class="why-desc">Curriculum at Pinnacle is structured in order to utilize inter-connected nature of subjects resulting in easier grasp of concepts</p>
					<h1 class="why-title"> Air Conditioned and Peaceful Campus</h1>
					<p class="why-desc">Classes at Pinnacle are always conducted in small batches, in order to maintain the best faculty student ratio. This helps in attain optimum student-teacher interactions during the class and hence concepts can be argued upon freely resulting in better understanding of the subject.</p>
					<p class="why-desc">We also keep all our classes air conditioned to keep a fresh mind. Our campus is secluded from the city traffic so that our students can focus better</p>

					<h1 class="why-title"> Tailor-Made Study Material and Library</h1>
					<p class="why-desc">Pinnacle provides a well designed study material to all its student by the name of “Pathfinder”. This study material has been stitched together by our dedicated faculty members and contains a plethora of problems and concepts required for securing the best rank. The study material has to be solved along with the regular classroom lectures for optimum utilization. We have designed our coursework and study material to complement each other and extracting the maximum out of it.</p>
					<p class="why-desc">
					We also maintain a rich and sufficient collection of books that a student requires during his studies result. Students can get books from the library or can study there the whole day long. This reduces financial burden while providing enough books to the student.
					</p>
					<h1 class="why-title"> Daily Practise Paper and Regular Assessment Tests</h1>
					<p class="why-desc">
						Lectures at Pinnacle are supplemented by giving daily practise tasks to the students in
						form of Daily Practise Papers (DPPs) that help a student get a better grasp of things taught in the class the very same day,</p>
					<p class="why-desc">
					We also conduct fortnight test Pinnacle Practise Tests (PPTs) to check the
					understanding of the subject. Based on the performance in PPTs, students are given
					assessment reports. Pinnacle believes that all students are not same, some grasp quickly
					and some not, hence we help the student choose the right strategy for him based on his
					report.
					</p>

					<h1 class="why-title">Motivational Lectures and Training Sessions</h1>
					<p class="why-desc">Competitive examinations do test the pressure handling capabilities of a student. There is immense pressure on students, and we acknowledge it. So we organize regular motivational sessions at our center and conduct workshops that helps student in managing and distributing this pressure, filling them with the required enthusiasm and charisma required for being at the Pinnacle of his/her career</p>

					<h1 class="why-title"> Scholarship</h1>
					<p class="why-desc">Getting best education and mentorship should not be constrained by finances, this is the motto of Pinnacle. We have hence created several scholarship scheme for everyone who’s willing to dedicate himself to his/her career. We offer upto 100% scholarship to all the deserving candidate, in return we expect more that 100% commitment from the student. If you are dreaming it, we’ll help you do it.
